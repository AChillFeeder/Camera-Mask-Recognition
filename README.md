# Camera Mask Recognition
## _A little jab at CounterFit Module and Face/Mask detection_

Camera Mask Recognition comes as a prototype to an automation-based approach to Covid-19 safety in enclosed spaces.
Through facial recognition and image processing the program recognizes wether the subject is wearing a mask or not, and - if desired - also takes into account the body temperature of said subject.
If the person comforms to the configured safety standards then a relay is activated and said person has access to the building, otherwise a warning is issued. 


## Features

- **Easy to setup**: scroll down to the Setup section for more information.
- **Accurate**: 90%+ accurate mask readings are the norm in regular conditions. False positives and False negatives are the exception, not the rule.
- **Clear and concise output**: 3 LED's of different colors convey clear messages.
- **Flexible**: Mask detection accuracy, the critical body temperature and whether to use temperature readings or not could all be set up.
- **Under Development**: This project is still under developement, so there are more features to come!
